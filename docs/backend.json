    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the EnTrans application's core features, including transport requests, offerings, and matching. It prioritizes authorization independence and clear security rules by adhering to the principles outlined in the prompt. User profiles are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, providing clear ownership. Transport requests and offerings are stored as subcollections of user profiles (`/users/{userId}/transportRequests` and `/users/{userId}/transportOfferings`), reinforcing ownership and enabling simple security rules based on `request.auth.uid == userId`. Transport matches are stored in a top-level `/transportMatches` collection. To ensure authorization independence, the `userProfileId` of both the `TransportRequest` and `TransportOffering` are denormalized into each `TransportMatch` document. This avoids the need for complex `get()` calls in the security rules to verify ownership. This design facilitates secure list operations (QAPs) by segregating data based on ownership. Each user can only list transport requests and offerings under their own user ID, ensuring that they cannot access data they are not authorized to see. The membership map approach is not applicable here, as there is no collaborative data."
